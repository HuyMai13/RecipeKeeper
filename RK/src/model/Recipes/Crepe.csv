"In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour and the eggs. 
Gradually add in the milk and water, stirring to combine. 
Add the salt and butter; beat until smooth.
Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium high heat. 
Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each crepe. 
Tilt the pan with a circular motion so that the batter coats the surface evenly.
Cook the crepe for about 2 minutes, until the bottom is light brown. 
Loosen with a spatula, turn and cook the other side. Serve hot.",,,,,
